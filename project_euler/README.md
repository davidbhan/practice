These are some of my solutions for Project Euler problems. All problems and more can be found here: https://projecteuler.net/archives

As optimization is critical to these problems, having an understanding of their run time is crucial. I wrote a simple script to run all my solutions in a batch and print out their run times. To run it, navigate to this folder and run `./getRuntimes.sh`
